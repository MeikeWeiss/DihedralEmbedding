**Abstract**  
A planar triangulation is a planar drawing of a maximal planar graph such that (1) any two drawn edges intersect at most in their endpoints and (2) every face of the drawing is bounded by a 3-cycle of the planar graph. In this paper, we investigate the construction of polyhedra arising from maximal planar graphs. In particular, we construct a family of maximal planar graphs with dihedral automorphism groups. Moreover, we demonstrate that these graphs can be realized as polyhedra in the Euclidean 3-space with dihedral symmetry groups. We achieve this result by exploiting Grünbaum-colourings.
